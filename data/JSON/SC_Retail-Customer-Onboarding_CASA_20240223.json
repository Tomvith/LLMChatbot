The operations and the features supported in this API\nare described in the following sections.\n\n<hr />\n\n##### Authentication    \nTo make a request to any of the APIs, the client has to\npresent an Access Token, following the OAuth 2.0 specifications.\n<br>The OAuth endpoints are summarized below. \n<a href=\"https://api.sc.com/retail/v1/oauth2/token\">https:\\/\\/api.sc.com\\/retail\\/v1\\/oauth2\\/token</a>\n<hr />\n **Parameters**\n <table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th width='15%'>Key</th>\n      <th width='85%'>Value</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>grant_type</td>\n      <td>Indicates the type of grant being presented in exchange for an access token and possibly a refresh token, for more details, please refer to the table below</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>client_id</td>\n      <td>The public identifier for the application, obtained when the caller first registered the application</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>client_secret</td>\n      <td>The applicationâ€™s client secret. This ensures that the request to get the access token is made only from the application, and not from a potential attacker that may have intercepted the authorization code.</td>\n    </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th width='15%'>Grant Type</th>\n      <th width='85%'>Usage</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Client credentials</td>\n      <td>For the client app to identify itself to the SC API platform, the <code> /token </code> endpoint has to be called with query param <code>grant_type</code> set to <code>client_credentials</code></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Auth-code based grant</td>\n      <td>For the client app to identify itself to the SC API platform, the <code> /token </code> endpoint has to be called with query param <code>grant_type</code> set to <code>auth_code_grant</code></td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<hr />\n\n##### Error Handling\n\nThe API endpoints return an error response whenever the request could not be processed successfully. In such scenarios, API provides the clients with a precise Application Error code and description in the error payload associated with HTTP Status codes 4xx or 5xx.\n <br>The table below provides a list of such possible Application Errors, for effective error handling of API consumers.\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th width='20%'>Response error code</th>\n      <th width='80%'>Detail</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>API-CASA-1-100</td>\n      <td>Input data is not valid</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>API-CASA-1-101</td>\n      <td>Invalid query parameters</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>API-CASA-2-100</td>\n      <td>Requested resource not found</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n",
